## What is exercism.io?
Learning to program is exhilarating and challenging... and also frustrating, exhausting, and overwhelming.

Exercism provides countless small wins. The exercises are achievable mini-quests: small and well-defined, 
and with enough complexity to uncover bite-sized knowledge gaps.

There's a gap when you're past the basics but real-world problems leave you swamped by details and wandering 
down rabbit holes. Exercism aims to fill that gap with lots of small, self-contained practice problems with 
just enough complexity to stretch your mind around new concepts.

## Why exercism ?
What I found really different about the exercism.io is the fact that it works through TDD aka Test Driven 
Development.If you've never done TDD before it might take a little bit of getting used to. Each language 
will do this slightly differently, but the main idea is that the test calls your solution and checks that 
the result is what it expects.

## Some of the benefits of Test Driven Development (TDD)?
* Writing the tests first requires you to really consider what do you want from the code
* Fast feedback
* Creates a detailed specification
* Reduces time spent on rework
* Less time spent in the debugger
* Tells you whether your last change (or refactoring) has broken previously working codes
* Allows the design to evolve and adapt to your changing understanding of the problem
* Forces radical simplification of the code, you will only write codes in response to the requirements of the tests
* Forces you to write small classes focused on one thing
* Maintainable, Flexible & Easily Extensible
